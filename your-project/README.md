## Project Description

Cancer is now one of the main reason of deaths in general. I wanted to talk about lung cancer accross the globe. Therefore,I focused my analysis on finding a  match between tobacco consumption and lung cancer. 


## Questions & Hypotheses

During my analysis I tried to answer, as precisely as I could with the data I had in my hands, to the following questions:

*[Impact of Cigarettes on cancer]*

*[Share of Cancer deaths related to tobacco]*

*[Impact of Wealth on the survival rate ]*

## Dataset

For the Datasets that I used I found a very interesting website that was proving a lot of information about cancer in general.
This is the link to the website: https://ourworldindata.org/cancer

## Workflow

I tried to look at health organisations to find data about cancer. Eventually, I got the link to the website I used to retrieve information. The datasets used were very precise but not very furnished with actual information.The data was still  interesting to use. I tried to clean several datasets and combine them to find correlations. This process was not always very successful. 
Regarding the questions that I asked myself to do the analysis I though about using the most appealing topics related to lung cancer within the website:https://ourworldindata.org/cancer.


## Organization

My repository is structured in the following way:

- data(data sets used)
- "cleaned" jupyter notebooks
- "analysed" jupyter notebooks
- graphs ( used to make the presentation)
- Powerpoint presentation of the project
- Report of the project

How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
